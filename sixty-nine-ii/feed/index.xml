		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Rachel, and love the reference to the Ugly Sisters. The assertion here is still being debated by the Association for the Measurement and Evaluation of Communications (AMEC) and a coalition of nearly every other association you can think of in this space, informally called The Conclave, but it looks like consensus is going Attenzi&#039;s way :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This page in particular really strikes a chord with me, particularly around tailoring and adapting comms metrics, tactics etc to reflect the uniqueness of organisations. There&#039;s not a one size fits all approach, and it&#039;s the word unique that jumps out at me. 

I&#039;ve long said you can&#039;t &#039;shoehorn&#039; certain aspects of communication or tools into an organisation because they&#039;ve worked elsewhere; you need to adapt and adopt the ideas to suit the individuality of the company and its people. To continue the analogy, we all know what happened when the Ugly Sisters tried on the glass slipper - an ill-fitting shoe does not make a princess! There are so many stand-out pages for me, but this is one of my favourites, Rachel.]]></description>
