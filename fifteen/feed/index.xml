		<description><![CDATA[Hazel, you&#039;re absolutely spot on as far as I&#039;m concerned, as you&#039;ll see I mention briefly in chapter 40. And since I finished this book we&#039;ve been thinking more about social business from the individual&#039;s (rather than organizational) perspective. I hope to post some more thoughts on this website soon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We now have so much data that the process of making it relevant - turning it into information - is struggling to catch up.  An abundance of data and a scarcity of people with the right skills to interpret it is never good - information itself only turns into knowledge when you add some insight.  

The later point about not just asking questions but knowing the questions to ask is also fundamental.

The interesting thing will be watching how all of this unfolds.  In the past, big brands have looked to the ad agencies as the gurus with the magic touch.  Now they not only need guidance from a wholly different type of consultant but need to look within the organisation for the talent to turn information into strategy.

It&#039;s great news for anyone fed up with being a corporate yes-man - the skills required to succeed in product development, marketing, almost any discipline will look radically different in a few years time.]]></description>
