		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a question we&#039;ve posed ourselves since this book was published...

Do you help all the individuals associated with your organisation (employees, customers, partners, suppliers, shareholders, etc.) build richer, more productive relationships with each other and others, coalescing by need and desire, knowledge and capability, shared values and shared value?

		<description><![CDATA[Hazel, you&#039;re absolutely spot on as far as I&#039;m concerned, as you&#039;ll see I mention briefly in chapter 40. And since I finished this book we&#039;ve been thinking more about social business from the individual&#039;s (rather than organizational) perspective. I hope to post some more thoughts on this website soon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We now have so much data that the process of making it relevant - turning it into information - is struggling to catch up.  An abundance of data and a scarcity of people with the right skills to interpret it is never good - information itself only turns into knowledge when you add some insight.  

The later point about not just asking questions but knowing the questions to ask is also fundamental.

The interesting thing will be watching how all of this unfolds.  In the past, big brands have looked to the ad agencies as the gurus with the magic touch.  Now they not only need guidance from a wholly different type of consultant but need to look within the organisation for the talent to turn information into strategy.

It&#039;s great news for anyone fed up with being a corporate yes-man - the skills required to succeed in product development, marketing, almost any discipline will look radically different in a few years time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Rachel, and love the reference to the Ugly Sisters. The assertion here is still being debated by the Association for the Measurement and Evaluation of Communications (AMEC) and a coalition of nearly every other association you can think of in this space, informally called The Conclave, but it looks like consensus is going Attenzi&#039;s way :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This page in particular really strikes a chord with me, particularly around tailoring and adapting comms metrics, tactics etc to reflect the uniqueness of organisations. There&#039;s not a one size fits all approach, and it&#039;s the word unique that jumps out at me. 

I&#039;ve long said you can&#039;t &#039;shoehorn&#039; certain aspects of communication or tools into an organisation because they&#039;ve worked elsewhere; you need to adapt and adopt the ideas to suit the individuality of the company and its people. To continue the analogy, we all know what happened when the Ugly Sisters tried on the glass slipper - an ill-fitting shoe does not make a princess! There are so many stand-out pages for me, but this is one of my favourites, Rachel.]]></description>
